This example contains the game 2048.

The following items are required to succesfully run this example as intended:

    - W2812B LEDs (the amount may vary accoriding to the size of your grid, standard is 5x5)
    - 1 Adruino Due 
    - 5 Breadboard buttons
    - 3.3V - 5.5V converter (https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/nl/spanning-converters/level-converters/robotdyn-spi-i2c-uart-bi-directionele-logic-level-converter-4-kanaals)
    - 1 500 Ohm resistor
    - breadboard cables (male-male & male-female)
    - power supply for the LEDs, minimum = (5V, amount_of_LEDs x 20mA) recommended = (5V, amount_of_LEDs x 60mA)  
    - 1 i2c OLED display 128 x 64 pixel monochroom
    - usb cable (to write data from a pc to the arduino)

To check where to connect the buttons and LEDs, check main.cpp.


When ready to run the program try "make run" in the terminal (assuming the arduino is connected)
